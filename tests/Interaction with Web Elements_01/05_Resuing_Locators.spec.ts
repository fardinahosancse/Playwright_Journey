// Our goal is to find elements in the most efficient way possible using their unique attributes.
// Sometimes elements can be located easily, but it can get tricky when elements share the same name.
// It is not a good practice to use nth() or first() â€“ as websites become dynamic, elements may shift, making refactoring a real hassle.
// Our goal here is to write the script in such a way that, regardless of changes to backend or frontend components, it will reliably find the element using a user-facing technique.
